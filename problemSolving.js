//What is an Algorithm?
// A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

/**   Probllem solving
 * 1.understanding the Provlem
 * 2.Explore conccrete example
 * 3.break it down
 * 4.solve/simplify
 * 5.Look back and refactor
 */

/**1.Understanding the problem
 * Ask question in order to understand the question
 * 1.can I restate the problem in my own words.
 * 2.what are the inputs that go into problem?
 * 3.what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the probem.
 * 5.How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem.


/**  2.Explore conccrete example
   * coming up with examples can help to understand the problem better
   * examples provides sanity checks that your eventula solution works how it should
   * user stories!
   * Unit Tests!
   * 1. start with simple examples
   * 2.progress to morecomplex examples
   * 3.explore exampre empty inputs
   * 4.exploreexamples with invalid inputs


/**3. Break it down
 * explicity write out the step you need to take
 * whihc means planning ahead of by commenting out the steps(write out the steps)
 */

/**4. Solve/Simplify
 * Solve the problem if you can't solve a simpler problem
 * 1. find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do
 * 2.Temporarily ignore that difficulty
 * 3.write a simplified solution
 * 4.Then incorporate that difficulty back in.
 */

/** 5. Look Back & Reafactor
 * congrats on solving it, but you are not done.
 * Refactoring questions
 * 1.can you check the result?
 * 2.cna you derive the result differently?
 * 3.cna you understand it at glacne?
 * 4.can you use the result or method for some other problem?
 * 5.cna you imporove the the performance of your solution?
 * 6.cna you think of ohter ways to refactor
 * 7.how have other people solved this prooblem?
