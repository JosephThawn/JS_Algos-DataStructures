//what is a log?
//The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number ot times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that's less than or equal to one.

//certaine searching alogrightsm have logarithmic time complexity
//effecient sorting algorithms involve logarithms.
//Recursion sometimes involves logrithic space complexity

//Big O notation can give us a high level ounderstanding of theim or space complexity of an algorithm
//Big O nantiation doesn't care about precision, only about geral trends(linera? quadratic? constant?)
//The time or space complexity (as measure by BigO)depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm.
